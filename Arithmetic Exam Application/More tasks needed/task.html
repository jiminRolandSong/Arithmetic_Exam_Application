<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Let's write an application that assesses the user's knowledge.<br/>
Many people get nervous during exams; they can accidentally hit a wrong key, confuse <code class="java">,</code> with <code class="java">.</code> in floats, and so on. Our application should allow some room for errors and give a person the opportunity to correct the typo.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>The application should give the user 5 tasks. The tasks are akin to the previous stage: two numbers from <code class="java">2</code> to <code class="java">9</code> and an integer operation.</li>
<li>The user receives one task, prints the answer. If the answer contains a typo (letters or otherwise empty), the program should print <code class="java">Incorrect format.</code> and ask to re-enter the answer. Repeat until the answer is in the correct format. If the answer is a number, print <code class="java">Right!</code> or <code class="java">Wrong!</code> depending on the answer and carry on to the next question.</li>
<li>After five tasks, output <code class="java">Your mark is n/5.</code> where <strong>n</strong><em> </em>is the number of correct answers.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>An example of the output</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">3 + 8
&gt; 11q
