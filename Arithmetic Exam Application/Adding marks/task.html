<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Simple tasks are good for younger kids, but math can be more difficult and more interesting! Quadratic equations, trigonometry, and a lot of other interesting things. Math library can help you with that.</p>
<p>Sometimes students want to save the results of the test. This is useful for viewing the learning dynamics on a topic or to identify difficult tasks.</p>
<p>At this stage, let's add integral squares. Of course, you can add more difficulty levels later.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>With the first message, the program should ask for a difficulty level:<br/>
	1 - simple operations with numbers 2-9<br/>
	2 - integral squares 11-29</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A user enters an answer.<br/>
	For the first difficulty level: the task is a simple math operation; the answer is the result of the operation.<br/>
	For the second difficulty level: the task is an integer; the answer is the square of this number.<br/>
	In case of another input: ask to re-enter. Repeat until the format is correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application gives 5 tasks to a user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user receives one task, prints the answer.<br/>
	    If the answer contains a typo, print <code class="java">Incorrect format.</code> and ask to re-enter the answer. Repeat until the answer is in the correct format.<br/>
	    If the answer is a number, print <code class="java">Right!</code> or <code class="java">Wrong!</code> Go to the next question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After five answers, print <code class="java">Your mark is N/5.</code> where <strong>N</strong><em> </em>is the number of correct answers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output <code class="java">Would you like to save your result to the file? Enter yes or no.</code><br/>
	In case of <code class="java">yes</code>, <code class="java">YES</code>, <code class="java">y</code>, <code class="java">Yes</code>: the app should ask the username and write <code class="java">Name: n/5 in level X (&lt;level description&gt;).</code> (X stands for the level number)<em> </em>in the <code class="java">results.txt</code><em> </em>file. For example â€” <code class="java">Alex: 3/5 in level 1 (simple operations with numbers 2-9).</code><br/>
	The results should be saved to the file immediately after the user gave the positive answer to the question <code class="java">Would you like to save your result to the file?</code><br/>
	If the file <code class="java">results.txt</code> does not exist, you should create it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case of <code class="java">no</code> or any other word: exit the program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Which level do you want? Enter a number:
1 - simple operations with numbers 2-9
2 - integral squares of 11-29
&gt; 11
Incorrect format.
Which level do you want? Enter a number:
1 - simple operations with numbers 2-9
2 - integral squares of 11-29
&gt; 2
11
&gt; 121
Right!
15
&gt; 100
Wrong!
21
&gt; 441'
Wrong format! Try again.
21
&gt; 441
Right!
17
&gt; 289
Right!
13
&gt; 169
Right!
Your mark is 4/5. Would you like to save the result? Enter yes or no.
&gt; yes
What is your name?
&gt; Kate
The results are saved in "results.txt".

<p>After finishing this stage, you are totally free to improve the project in any way you like to make it a more convenient and useful tool.</p>
<p>You can add any features to your application. It will not be verified by tests, so there are no strict requirements.</p>
<p>Sample ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a complex exam. Increase a difficulty level on the fly. For example, if a person passed the 1st level, start the 2nd one immediately.</li>
<li>You can add a correction level: store the tasks with wrong answers and give them next time.</li>
<li>Add more difficulty levels.</li>
<li>Track the time (read about Timer).</li>
<li>Write a more detailed report to a file with the results.</li>
<li>Show previous results inside the app (show lines from <code class="java">results.txt</code> that contains the username)</li>
<li>Any other improvement that might be useful!</li>
</ol>
