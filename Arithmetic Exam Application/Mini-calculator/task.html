<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>People learn new things in one way or another. Learning sometimes means that you need to check your comprehension by taking a test. It also requires a person (or a program) to check your answers. You may have been in a situation when you think that you have solved the task correctly, but your professor has a different (sometimes wrong!) answer. It happens; everybody makes mistakes.</p>
<p>Not our application though. It should calculate the solution in a very precise manner. We need to make a simple calculator that can evaluate expressions like <code class="java">a + b</code>, <code class="java">a - b</code>, or <code class="java">a * b</code>. We will leave the division aside for now.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>A user inputs a line that looks like a simple mathematical operation.</li>
<li>The application should print the result of the operation.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; 5 + 7
12</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; 3 * 100
300</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; 5 - 10
-5</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; 8 * 0
0</code></pre>
